# Hello-world
This is my first project. Learning how to use GitHub!
Hi, I'm a computer engineering student, and I'm excited about becoming an expert programmer! I'm an old guy but really willing to succeed in this business. I'm a little bit lost now about where to start, with basic knowledge of PHP, Java, Javascript, HTML and CSS.
